Personal exploration of various algorithms and their application.

## Imaging
### Ultrasound Imaging
#### Spatiotemporal Filtering
##### SVD
* A challenge in super-resolution ultrasound (SRUS) imaging is to seperate microbubble signal (relevant to blood flow) from tissue signal and noise. Spatiotemporal filtering is done in SRUS through the reorganization of temporal and spatial information using the Casorti matrix and leveraging SVD. 

### Adaptive Thresholding
* Otsu's method
